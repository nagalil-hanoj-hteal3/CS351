**Programming Languages - CSUSM**

***Taught by Professor Cary Jardin*** -- Spring 2022

*Co/Prerequisites: CS 311, and MATH 270 or 370. 	
Important features and concerns of implementation design on programming languages in common use today will be studied and analyzed.  Includes data and control structures, run-time storage management, context-free grammars, language translation systems, programming paradigms, and distributed and parallel programming constructs.*

***Description:***  This 16 week course is designed to provide students the foundation to choose the right tool, for the right job. Students will be exposed to historic, current, and future programming languages while having hands on experience implementing formal
compiler theory in creating their own language. Course Objectives directly reflect the ACM 2013 Course Curricula for Programming Languages.

**Course Objectives** 
1. Provide students the knowledge needed to make educated decisions about the selection of
the programming languages that will affect their work and careers.
2. Understand, evaluate, and apply the fundamentals of Object-oriented design.
3. Effectively work with the utility of Functional Programming, and successfully implement
data structure algorithm design.
4. Expose students to Event-Driven and Reactive Programming through both user interface
event handling, and “game engine” reactive based paradigms.
5. Understand, reflect, and form opinions of basic type systems.
6. Be able to successfully attack the challenge of creating a programming language from
scratch and understanding all fundamental compiler theory.
7. Experience, and quantify the impact of interpreted, compiled, and just-in-time compilation
of programming languages.
8. Work with concurrency and parallelism within current programming languages, and explore
the industry trend of cloud asymmetric processing resources.
9. Respect the history, and culture of Computer Science that has produced the tools we have
today.
10. Understand the role of a Computer Scientist in the industry.
